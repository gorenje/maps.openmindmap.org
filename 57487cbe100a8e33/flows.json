To generate better brainstorming questions;\n\n- Start with a clear goal: Define the purpose of the brainstorming session and what you hope to achieve. This clarity will help you come up with relevant questions easily.\n\n- Avoid closed-ended questions: Instead of questions with yes/no answers, use open-ended questions that invite discussion and exploration.\n\n- Focus on “What If” and “How Might”: Use questions that begin with phrases like “What if…” or How might we…. These encourage imaginative thinking and idea generation.\n\n- Understand your audience: Consider the participants' backgrounds, expertise, and perspectives. Tailor your questions to their knowledge and interests.\n\n- Focus on a single topic: Keep your questions focused on one aspect or challenge to maintain clarity and prevent confusion\n\n- Ask one question at a time: Keep questions concise and specific. Asking multiple questions simultaneously can lead to confusion.\n\n","sumPass":false,"sumPassPrio":0,"sumPassNodeId":"","createdAt":"2024-11-19T11:09:32.445Z","updatedAt":"2024-11-19T11:10:28.636Z","x":981,"y":414,"wires":[["75a3d175909a0b05","dafbabee8f3c2e2f","fc47ef941b60484e"]]},{"id":"75a3d175909a0b05","type":"Topic","z":"57487cbe100a8e33","name":"“How Might”","info":"","sumPass":false,"sumPassPrio":0,"sumPassNodeId":"","createdAt":"2024-11-19T11:09:32.445Z","updatedAt":"2024-11-19T11:10:47.503Z","x":1370,"y":415,"wires":[[]]},{"id":"dafbabee8f3c2e2f","type":"Topic","z":"57487cbe100a8e33","name":"focus","info":"","sumPass":false,"sumPassPrio":0,"sumPassNodeId":"","createdAt":"2024-11-19T11:09:32.446Z","updatedAt":"2024-11-19T11:09:32.446Z","x":1387,"y":456,"wires":[[]]},{"id":"fc47ef941b60484e","type":"Topic","z":"57487cbe100a8e33","name":"“what if\"","info":"","sumPass":false,"sumPassPrio":0,"sumPassNodeId":"","createdAt":"2024-11-19T11:09:32.446Z","updatedAt":"2024-11-19T11:09:49.434Z","x":1431,"y":503,"wires":[[]]},{"id":"aab41afae375cfbf","type":"Text","z":"57487cbe100a8e33","name":"...
