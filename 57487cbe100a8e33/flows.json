To generate better brainstorming questions;\n\n- Start with a clear goal: Define the purpose of the brainstorming session and what you hope to achieve. This clarity will help you come up with relevant questions easily.\n\n- Avoid closed-ended questions: Instead of questions with yes/no answers, use open-ended questions that invite discussion and exploration.\n\n- Focus on “What If” and “How Might”: Use questions that begin with phrases like “What if…” or How might we…. These encourage imaginative thinking and idea generation.\n\n- Understand your audience: Consider the participants' backgrounds, expertise, and perspectives. Tailor your questions to their knowledge and interests.\n\n- Focus on a single topic: Keep your questions focused on one aspect or challenge to maintain clarity and prevent confusion\n\n- Ask one question at a time: Keep questions concise and specific.
