There are some twenty nodes and hence I have no published them.\n\nHence if this node is imported, Node-RED will complain about missing node types.\n\n:::\n\n::: background\n\nBased on this [discussion](https://discourse.nodered.org/t/noisecraft-anyone-heard-of-it/79813/9?u=gregorius).\n\nThis mindmap is the basis for this [article](https://blog.openmindmap.org/blog/pipes-wires-nodes) discussing the interpretations of flow diagrams.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nNoisecraft uses a state machine concept and flows actually describe the changes in state of that machine. At each point in time the flow has a state and with the tick of a clock, the state gets updated.\n\nNode-RED is event driven and describes the changes to the data that flows through the flows. If there is no event, then there is no data and hence the flow is *empty*.\n\n:::\n\n","env":[]},{"id":"2804d83f00f12df8","type":"Idea","z":"e642c9a2598507ed","name":"Wire, Pipes and Flows","info":"","sumPass":false,"sumPassPrio":0,"sumPassNodeId":"","createdAt":"2023-08-28T16:35:16.412Z","updatedAt":"2023-08-28T16:35:28.702Z","x":164.5,"y":395.50006103515625,"wires":[["6e338f3c507acbce","36fafbdc7866bcf0"]]},{"id":"6e338f3c507acbce","type":"Thought","z":"e642c9a2598507ed","name":"State machine v.
